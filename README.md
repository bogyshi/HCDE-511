# HCDE 511: Data Visualiztion
This course emphasised the principles of graphical excellence, including properties such as graphical integrity, visual seeking mantra, principles of apprehension, and more. We took time to hone our skills of tableau and other visualization tools. In my case I took time to explore Bokeh.

You can find supporting scripts and workbook in the finalProj directory. This project allow users to explore the crime report data set offered by the Seattle Police Departement. We included __population__ and __time of day__ information as filters that were not included before. There is a paper on our process and results also included in the finalProj folder. Feel free to adjust the workbook in anyway that may improve analysis.
